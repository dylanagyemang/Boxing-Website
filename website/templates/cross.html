<div class="term" id='straight'><h3>The Straight - 2 </h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        One the most powerful punches that can be thrown often preceded by a jab or lead hook. Executed by 
        turning the hips and throwing the rear hand in a straight line, generally through the guard of the 
        opponent.
        <div class="dboxers">
            Notable Users: Floyd Mayweather, Mohammad Ali, Lennox Lewis
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='chop'><h3>Chopping Right/Left</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        Distinct from an Overhand but the concept is similar in that the punch comes in a downward motion, however 
        generally the fighter throwing it remains upright and uses more of a chopping motion.
            <div class"dboxers">
                Notable Users: Thomas Hearns, Lennox Lewis, Larry Holmes
            </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='corkscrew'><h3>Corkscrew Punch</h3></div> 
    <div class="def">
        A very powerful straight where the power is generated by the torque of twisting the fist such that the 
        palm faces outward.
            <div class="dboxers">
                Notable Users: Charles Kid McCoy, Wladamir Klitschko, Anthony Joshua
            </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='cross'><h3>The Cross</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        Distinct from the straight in that the elbow is slightly bent and the punch is thrown around and over 
        the opponent’s jab across the body. It doesn’t necessarily have to be thrown over the jab to be considered 
        a cross, the mechanics are slightly different in that the punch does not come in a straight line but a very 
        small arc and across from the right side to the left.
            <div class"dboxers">
                Notable Users: Muhammad Ali, Floyd Mayweather, Archie Moore
            </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='feint'><h3>Feint/Fake Cross</h3><div>
    <div class="def">
        A tool used to disorient your opponent or create an opening, executed by only 
        partially extending the rear hand then retracting it.
        <div class="dboxers">
            Notable Users: Muhammad Ali, Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, Tyson Fury
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='loop'><h3>Looping Punch</h3><div>
    <div class="def">
        This punch resembles a hook but has a longer range and a much wider arc than all other variants, 
        often goes around the guard and hits the side of the temple or on the ear.
        <div class="dboxers">
            Notable Users: Erislandy Lara, Terrence Crawford, Larry Holmes
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='over'><h3>Overcut/Overhand Right/Left</h3></div> 
    <div class="def">
        A more exaggerated form of the cross, the arc of the punch flies over the head of the boxer throwing the 
        punch and crashes down on the opponent’s cheek, temple or chin. Executed generally during or after a drop 
        step or transitioning from an upright stance to a full crouch. 
        <div class="dboxers">
            Notable Users: Shawn Porter, Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='short'><h3>Short Straight</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        Less powerful than the other variants the short straight is thrown from a closer range in some cases 
        room is provided for the punch during the punch by pulling the upper body back as you throw the punch. 
        Usually thrown when the back is on the ropes.
        <div class="dboxers">
            Notable Users: James Toney, Lennox Lewis, Floyd Mayweather
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='body'><h3>Straight to the body</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        Similar to the straight but requires more of a lunging motion to reach the body and in some cases 
        loops around the guard. 
            <div class"dboxers">
                Notable Users: Floyd Mayweather, Roy Jones Jr., Marcos Maidana
            </div>
    </div>
<div class="term" id='under'><h3>Underhand Straight</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        Generally used by shorter fighters but can be used when in a crouched position, this punch is similar to 
        the 45-degree jab where the punch comes up from a low angle.
