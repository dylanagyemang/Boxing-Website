<div class="term"><h3>Boxer-Puncher</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        A style of boxer who lacks the speed and mobility of a pure boxer and 
        the strength and power of a slugger, however he blends the two styles to be able to 
        compete strongly with either style. While it's possible for them to be outboxed by 
        a superior boxer or overwhelmed by the power of a slugger he tends to do well against 
        swarmers, whose natural kryptonite are generally sluggers. The power of a boxer puncher as 
        well as his mobility allows him to potentially break down swarmers, can confuse and frustrate 
        sluggers with their mobility, and overpower pure boxers with their power and ability to move fast 
        enough to cut off the ring.

        using hand traps sneaky uppercuts, savage body work, collar ties and over/underhooks to control 
        their opponents and break their body and spirit. They tend to do well against swarmers because of their 
        ability to smother and control their opponent they tend not to fair so well against pure boxers that can adjust
        or clinch well but also have the ability to dominate boxers if they can't adjust or maintain their rhythm.

        and accuracy to snipe and overwhelm his opponent with clean scoring punches. While they 
        generally lack power; either due to depending on their mobility and hence, can’t properly 
        “sit down” on their punches or they developed a pure boxing style to compensate for their 
        lack of natural ability to hurt their opponents, they depend on frustrating their opponents 
        and dragging them to the finish line, forcing their opponents to expend energy by missing 
        power shots and chasing the boxer from post to post. Pure boxers are generally referred to 
        as out-fighters however some pure boxers can fight on the 'inside' or 'outside'.

        they land a single shot. You can never count a slugger out; they possess the power to knock 
        out their opponent at any time. Stylistically their weakness tend to be pure boxers who outscore and

        with combinations. Naturally the kryptonite of pure boxers because the storm of punches disrupts 
        their rhythm and outscores their conservative pot shotting or counterpunching style. An adage by 
        most swarmers is to take one punch to land two or three.
