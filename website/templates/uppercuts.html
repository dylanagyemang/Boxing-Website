<div class="term"><h3>Corkscrew Punch</h3></div>

<div class="term"><h3>The Cross</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        Distinct from the straight in that the elbow is slightly bent and the punch is thrown around and over 
        the opponent’s jab across the body. It doesn’t necessarily have to be thrown over the jab to be considered 
        a cross, the mechanics are slightly different in that the punch does not come in a straight line but a very 
        small arc and across from the right side to the left.

    <div class="def">

<div class="term"><h3>Overcut/Overhand Right/Left</h3></div> 
    <div class="def">
        A more exaggerated form of the cross, the arc of the punch flies over the head of the boxer throwing the 
        punch and crashes down on the opponent’s cheek, temple or chin. Executed generally during or after a drop 
        step or transitioning from an upright stance to a full crouch.

<div class="term"><h3>Short Straight</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        Less powerful than the other variants the short straight is thrown from a closer range in some cases 
        room is provided for the punch during the punch by pulling the upper body back as you throw the punch. 
        Usually thrown when the back is on the ropes.

<div class="term"><h3>Straight to the body</h3></div>
    <div class="def">
        Similar to the straight but requires more of a lunging motion to reach the body and in some cases 
        loops around the guard.

    <div class="def">
        Generally used by shorter fighters but can be used when in a crouched position, this punch is similar to 
        the 45-degree jab where the punch comes up from a low angle.
